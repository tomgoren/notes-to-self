## Recipe

* Takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on thickness of fish

### Ingredients

* Salmon fillets skin-on, works with bbq cuts also
* Olive oil
* Soy sauce
* Whole grain mustard (we usually use Maille Old Style mustard, but I think Trader Joe's has an equivalent product)

### Preparation

_Note: Non-stick pan preffered over cast iron due to acidity of mustard_
* Heat pan with olive oil at medium heat
* Add 1.5 teaspoons of mustard
* Add 1.5 tablespoons of soy sauce
* Stir
* Add fish skin side up
* Flip when sides show cooked almost half way through (maybe 5-6 minutes)
* Flip again, cook until thickest part is at least at 155°F
  * If no meat thermometer is available, just cut the fish in half and inspect visually
  * Light pink and tough means overdone
  * Dark wet slimy pink means undercooked

### Serving

Pairs well with:

* Bulgur
* Rice
* Cooked greens
* Fresh salad
