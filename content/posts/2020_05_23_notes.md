## Hello
Happy weekend!

### Culture
* [_The Equatics - Doin It!!!!_](https://open.spotify.com/album/4SN55bwEnC0T1qmBTWZeyW?si=qSXGYDMLQHi4fKXYw0UNSQ). A high school band from Hampton, Virginia, recorded this in 1972. I enjoyed the renditions of some their era's popular songs, including Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By", and Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine". The sound is raw and the delivery is convincing. 
* [Not Viral News](https://notviral.news/): Excellent, informative, and fun.
* A [touching ode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khjKkCW4LjY) to a lovable and humble star, John Candy.
