## Music

I listened to the podcast series [Fela Kuti: Fear No Man](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fela-kuti-fear-no-man/id1835735529).
I knew about Fela's music and was aware that he was a prominent figure and a founder of the Afrobeat
genre, but I had no idea about his activism or cultural significance. I was also only vaguely aware of
criticism against him and the podcast highlighted both his contributions and some of his problematic behaviors and opinions.
The series is extremely well produced, and I enjoyed learning about the historical and familial context that created this singular artist.

## Tech

* [`sqlit`](https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit): It's been a while since I've needed to use such a thing, but this seems like a nice way to interact with databases from the terminal. Akin to `lazygit`.
