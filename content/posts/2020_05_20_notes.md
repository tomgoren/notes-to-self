## Hello
Today is a Wednesday.

### Culture
* Disc 2 of [Bobo Yéyé: Belle Époque in Upper Volta](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tGlp1d3Lv1e1EezFKFmyB?si=xa1osEafQF698uMuytVZFw). Pitchfork did an [extensive write up](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22593-bobo-yeye-belle-epoque-in-upper-volta/) about it. Festive, poignant, atmospheric. The [two minute promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp64ktL9l6k) provides a way to sample before diving in.
* I enjoyed this excellent [lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSuK_5zW2iM) from Adam Neely. I learned about music theory, art, and screaming goats.

### Tech
* I need to read [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action-second-edition).
* [This](https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html) is not the most straightforward way to learn Ruby.
