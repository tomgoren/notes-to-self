## Educational

* [Fascinating talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF3XJT9YKpM) on how we express ourselves with visual communication and share abstract ideas from Prof. Judy Fan.

## Tech

* Sarah Reichelt gave an [excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSoxINozBKU) at Pycon AU about how to escape "tutorial hell".
It provides a useful and practical framework on how to plan and start a project, with a strong emphasis on preparation before implementation.
In addition, one of my favorite takeaways is: "Never get an AI to write code that you couldn't have written yourself."
I've definitely fallen into this trap before and it's quite pernicious.
* I've gone through the [`helix`](https://helix-editor.com/) tutorial now several times, and I'm hoping to retrain my muscle memory sufficiently to make the jump soon.
Partially inspired by Julia Evans' [notes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/) own journey.

## Fun

* Gianmarco Soresi's new special ["Thief of Joy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB9eWtzTOq0). Funny, edgy, theatrical.
