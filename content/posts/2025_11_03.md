## Precision

* ["He's lived above this workshop for 50 years making parts for bullet trains,
satellites, and nuclear power stations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jvxrUfvfYw)

## Tech

* [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5fmhYc4U-Y) from Professor Robert M. "r0ml" Lefkowitz,
it one that I revisit and share frequently. My main takeaway is r0ml's third law: _"Any distributed system based on exchanging data will be
replaced by a system based on exchanging programs."_ I find it fascinating and possibly prescient with
regards to MCP nowadays. At this point I can only be struck with awe by the APL and GPU programming examples.

## Fun

* [Kopi Luwak coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_luwak) is something I learned about only recently.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkbuFwHnJQY) is James Hoffmann talking about it, and [here](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/fermentation-is-key-to-coffee-beans-gleaned-from-civet-feces/) is a recent
article that seems to support that there is something unique about it after all.
