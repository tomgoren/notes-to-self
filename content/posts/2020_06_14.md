## Culture
* [William Wegman's work](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/arts/design/william-wegman-hello-nature-at-bowdoin-college-museum.html) feels like an oblique intersection of nature, pop art, and nostalgia.
* Large scale temporary sculptures in an Russian national park: [Nikola-Lenivets Art-Park](https://rusmania.com/nikola-lenivets-the-largest-art-park-in-europe).
* Armin KÃ¼pper - "Pipelinefunk" - [A guy playing a saxophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8GcHoSIPDg) into an enormous pipe.

## Tech
* Cool idea, great value, and unbelievable creativity. Over [1,700 indie games for next to nothing](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality), and all proceeds go to a worthy cause.

## Random
* Once upon a time there was a [weirdo chemistry wiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Leonard_Pickard).
* He produced epic proportions of LSD in an old ICBM bunker in Kansas, where his shady business partner conducted unsavory affairs.
* One of the people who spent a good deal of time in the underground acid palace was the subject of a [Vice documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qliVpGEk0).
