## Tech

* Homelab plans:
  * Self-host [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and [Zulip](https://zulip.com/)
  * Wrap up migration from Google Photos to self-hosted NAS with [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) file sync
    * Last time I tried this, I ran into some issues with reconstituting from Google Takeout

## Woodworking

* My table saw is in good enough shape now for most tasks, but I really want to follow [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad1bySe4CBw) to get it set up properly

## Other

* Thanks to [Libby](https://libbyapp.com), I've been listening to [The Dawn of Everything](https://libbyapp.com/shelf/similar-6011293/page-1/6011293) by David Graeber and David Wengrow.
  * These are my thoughts so far:
    * It is a sprawling, well-cited, and inclusive analysis of human nature based on
      actual anthropological and archeological findings and science.
    * The book is an essential counterbalance to the prescriptive, less-founded,
      and unfortunately popular narratives that tend to be somehow all be
      subtly reactionary and conservative in their approach
      (Jared Diamond, Yuval Noah-Harari, etc.).
    * TDoE manages to steer clear of platitudes and dictums about
      the inevitability of one form of government or social stratification,
      and instead it provides a wide variety of examples of the human experience
      from time immemorial.
    * I find fascinating how the same evidence can be interpreted in different ways,
      and the complexity involved in piecing together the lives of people from so long ago.
