## Music

* corto.alto: [30/108](https://open.spotify.com/album/3AJCY0q66jb1ItviCx4wnQ?si=niUkc_4BSWe5Q0Non02OXA)
  * Liam Shortall is a multi-instrumentalist from Glasgow, and has been making some of the hardest hitting, most fun music I've heard in a while. This album contains multiple examples of sonically rich, tight funky grooves. I love the horn player's anguished screaming sax, and the impeccable drum performances.
* Ray Barretto: [Eye Of The Beholder](https://open.spotify.com/album/1oqvCB6uVrb11vQID4aB0s?si=A6HeZ7t-TF20rnhLBmfHxA)
  * Discovering this giant of Latin Jazz in this 1977 album full of energetic and dramatic funk. [Barry Finnerty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Finnerty) gives it his all and delivers a outworldly guitar solo on the frenetic track 4, "Salsa-Con-Fusion".
* Oneness Of Juju: [African Rhythms](https://open.spotify.com/album/5By1WjsMoJeI3qrFb4k8VB?si=Sjw2sgYeSRuuC-D2qs0cxA)
  * Learning about this project by [James "Plunky" Branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_%22Plunky%22_Branch). I love the confluence of 1975 funk with jazzy harmonies, occasional swing, traditional African folk chants and instrumentation. Altogether I enjoyed the slightly off-kilter feeling and exploratory sense.

## Tech

* [Kubero](https://www.kubero.dev/): Install an enormous variety of out-of-box services on Kubernetes. Looking at these for more self-hosted shenanigans.
* [Plausible](https://plausible.io/): Open source web-analytics. Self-hosted replacement to Google Analytics.
* Made the switch from Vanilla [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) to opinionated [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/). While at it, refreshed my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tomgoren/dotfiles).
