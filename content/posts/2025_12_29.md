## Art

* [Kenneth Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Price), from [artnet]:
> Ken Price was an American artist best known for his small-scale ceramic sculptures which resembled biomorphic blobs, sliced geodes, and surreal teacups. 
* Chroniclers of life in the High Alps: [Giovanni Segantini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Segantini) and [Ferdinand Hodler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Hodler).

## Music

* [Derya Yıldırım & Grup Şimşek](https://open.spotify.com/album/5l7ypUMco5BLsIYBjIYWay?si=bFqiBdzlR6OaN8yk0LFEmg) - a new album, "Yarın Yoksa" for this band out of Istanbul. The music is rich and full of fun alongside heartfelt sentiments.

## Tech

* [Illuminating article](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/) on how digital photography processes images, and peels the meaning behind what constitutes a "raw" photo.
* As a markdown aficionado, I'd like to think that the next time I give a presentation that I would use [`presenterm`](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm).
* Promising challenge to the hegemony of Datadog coming from [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/). They've produced an impressive library of reference docs
* I haven't yet used it yet, but I like the idea of an open solution like [Open Feature](https://openfeature.dev/) vs. something proprietary like LaunchDarkly.
