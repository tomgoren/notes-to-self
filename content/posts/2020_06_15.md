## Overview

We need two components to get up and running with our Python projects:

* A way to manage versions of Python on our machines
* A way to manage dependencies for each of our projects

Not so long ago, my solution of choice would probably be `pyenv`, and `virtualenv`, respectively.

In fact, I would probably just follow [this guide](https://www.kensodev.com/posts/2018/10/17/installing-python-3.7-and-making-it-the-default-on-osx/).

However, that was then, and this is now.

## asdf

[`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) is a utility to manage multiple runtime versions for a variety of popular interpreters.

Follow the [very nice instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm) to get it set up for your particular environment.

## Poetry

Again, [the docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) do a very good job of explaining how to get up and running.

## That's it

No more `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`. Just a [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/tomgoren/notes-to-self/blob/master/pyproject.toml).

## Note

This changes an [old post](https://notes.tomgoren.com/how-this-blog-is-hosted.html) slightly, because now I run:

		poetry run pelican content && \
		poetry run pelican --listen

When I edit this blog.
