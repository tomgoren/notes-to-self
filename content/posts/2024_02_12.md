## Previously
The [previous installment in this series](https://notes.tomgoren.com/posts/some_basics/) provided a bit of background and introduced a select few terms. In this post, I will focus on a few practical things I think might be useful for a beginner looking to try out some tools and acquire basic skills. I am a big believer in project-based learning, and so I will use an example to demonstrate how these things go together in practice.

## Prerequisites
- [`Website`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) and [`Web page`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) on Wikipedia. These entries describe parts of the Internet that we interact with the most.
- ["Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) - an excellent and comprehensive introduction to one of the most commonly used tools, `git`. This video is easy to follow along, and covers a few useful fundamental commands and resources on how to get started from scratch.
