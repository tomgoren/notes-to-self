## Previously

The [previous installment in this series](https://notes.tomgoren.com/posts/some_basics/) provided a bit of background and introduced a select few terms. In this post, I will focus on a few practical things I think might be useful for a beginner looking to try out some tools and acquire basic skills. I am a big believer in project-based learning, and so I will provide some ideas that might be good ways to put the knowledge to practice.

## Recommended reading/watching

### Theory

- Read the Wikipedia entries for the terms ["Website"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) and ["Web page"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page). These describe the parts of the Internet that we interact with the most.
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWslE3uejuI) does a nice job explaining some of the related key elements and concepts as well.

### Tools

- ["Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) - an excellent and comprehensive introduction to one of the most commonly used tools, `git`. This video is easy to follow along, and covers a few useful fundamental commands and resources on how to get started from scratch.
- For Microsoft Windows users, the Windows Subsystem for Linux seems to be a useful way to have a Linux based development environment with minimal hassle. [This](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment) is a straightforward guide on how to get it setup. 
- Selecting a text editor is a personal choice, which should ideally be driven by convenience, preference, and using the right tool for the job. It doesn't really matter. That said, _I_ personally enjoy `vim` and have used some variant of it almost daily for 20 years now. [This playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACD8WEnImo&list=PLT98CRl2KxKHy4A5N70jMRYAROzzC2a6x) is an tremendous resource for anyone who wants to learn how to use `vim`.
  - If you _do_ go down this path, I recommend [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) eventually.


## Build something!

- A website! With GitHub pages one can host a static website for free. Their [initial setup intructions](https://pages.github.com/) are a great starting point, especially once the materials in the "Theory" section are understood.
  - [Learning HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) can be an advantage, but it's not strictly necessary.
  - An advanced exercise might be to [setup a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the website.
- After getting the hang of the development flow, i.e. writing files, committing changes to the Git repository, publishing the static pages, etc., one might find a static site generator more powerful and interesting. My current favorite is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## A short word

The information provided here is purposefully limited. For a beginner, infinite choice and open endedness can be a hindrance to the learning process. Also, notably missing are some explanations and explicit mentions of assumptions made when composing this post. My hope is to elaborate on these in the future, and in the meanwhile to provide a self service "get up and running" reference.
