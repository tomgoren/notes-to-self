## Recipe

* Makes about 3-4 portions
* Can be stored in fridge for a few days
* Tends to solidify some, so if reheating after refrigeration, best to mix with some yogurt

### Ingredients

* `1` cup **steel cut oats**
* `1.5` cups **milk**
* `1.5` cups **water**
* `0.5` teaspoons **salt**
* `1.5` tablespoons **flaxseeds** _or_ **chia seeds**
* `~1` teaspoon **cinnamon**
* `~4` tablespoons **chopped up pecans**
* `~2-3` tablespoons **raisins**

### Preparation

* Put everything in instant pot and mix a bit
* Set to pressure cook for **4 minutes**
* Leave it alone ("natural release" in Instant Pot nomenclature) for **10 minutes** to avoid a mess of sputtering milky goop

### Serving

Some suggestions of things that are nice to add:

* maple syrup
* honey
* yogurt
* jam
* nut butter
* cashews
* pumpkin seeds
* fresh berries or other chopped fresh fruit
