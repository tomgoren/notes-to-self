I’m an infrastructure-focused software engineer based in Portland,
currently working on cloud infrastructure at Gusto.
Over the last 15+ years I’ve worked across DevOps, SRE,
and platform engineering roles at companies including Stytch,
Wistia, and ClassPass,
mostly building and operating reliable systems with Go, Kubernetes, and AWS.
I care about practical tooling, resilient operations,
and helping teams ship with confidence.

Outside of work, I’m a longtime technologist and lifelong maker who spends most
of my non-work time creating, training,
and learning alongside my partner and two kids.
I’m into woodworking, writing, and making music,
along with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and fitness.
I love languages, and try to live in ways that align with ecological,
communal, and solarpunk values while staying creative and physically active.

Currently running [Kismet Engineering](https://kismet.engineering/) as a home
for experimentation and learning.
