* [Shakedown; A film by Leilah Weinraub](https://shakedown.film/) - `Anonymous` on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1794951/plotsummary) describes it as such:
> SHAKEDOWN chronicles explicit performances in an underground lesbian club in Los Angeles. The story functions as a legend where money is both myth and material. Cumulatively, questions arise about how to diagram the before and after of a utopic moment. Directed by Leilah Weinraub.
