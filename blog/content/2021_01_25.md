## Culture
* [Blick Bassy - Mpodol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZaDnzVz3PM) - I love the arrangement, the cello used as a bass, and the brass prominent but soft. The rhythm constantly moves.
* [Nick Shoulders - Heart of Glass](https://youtu.be/07o-R_YGDSs) - Nick Shoulders has excellent original material, but I love his rendition of this Blondie classic. I also love [his quarantine tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaU7x9zOtu0) with Dylan Earl (who has some [great stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PumG29esOo) of his own as well).
* [Liziqi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b_lIKhvThM) - Gardening and beyond, beautifully presented.

## Tech
* [`rust-starter`](https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter) - "A simple framework to build Rust CLI Applications"
* [On the fractal nature of effort estimates](https://realfiction.net/2016/02/28/on-the-fractal-nature-of-effort-estimates) - a classic allegory on the topic of project planning in software development, though possibly generally applicable to any field.
