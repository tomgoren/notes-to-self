## Hello
These are some things that I've been curious about lately (2020/05/19):

### Culture
* [_Silver Jews - American Water_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7LO24Uu9c0vuFUtHDAj0Wa?si=hGiIgdWeTFySorP8XaL5Zg): A rock band the product of art scholars, the Silver Jews created a golem of their period's zeitgeist, which we can now enjoy 20 years later. Shout out to Dr. Milner for the recommendation!
* This is a [person building a weed wacker bike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA23qLvl79k) in an enthusiastic, yet impolite and subtly violent fashion.

### Tech
* I am now a fledgling `zsh` convert, after many years of `bash` zealotry. This is thanks in part to [starship](https://starship.rs/).
* On the Mac, I prefer the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) variants of common tools (e.g. `grep`, `awk`, `screen`). [This is an excellent guide](https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/) on setting them up.

### Dreams
* I'd like to some day migrate my Amazon wish list to [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/). There doesn't seem to be an _easy_ way to automate this.
