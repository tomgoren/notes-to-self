## Hello

These are some things that I've been curious about lately (2020/05/09):

### Culture
* [Patrick Willie’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MagikDragon/about). Patrick is a “Navajo Hoop Dancer from Utah”, and on his channel he hosts a “[Natives React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKphsu9M-U)” series with his friend, Jacob Billy. It is a window into a rich and wonderful world.
* The [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vHDlFByPg) of [Cosmo Sheldrake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo_Sheldrake). Cosmo is a super talented multi-instrumentalist and artist, who leverages electronic loops to self accompany his blend of acappella, folk, jazz, beatbox, funk, and more, to create a genre-transcendent groove with a unique soundscape.
* The [Committee for Skeptical Inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Skeptical_Inquiry) (CSI). A non-profit whose list of fellow and award recipients include some of the most prominent single-eyebrow-raisers of our time.
* The pure joy of this [Khruangbin music video](https://youtu.be/oc50wHexbwg).

### Tech

* Rust’s [Serde framework](https://serde.rs/)
* The [Go for Python Programmers](https://golang-for-python-programmers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) book
