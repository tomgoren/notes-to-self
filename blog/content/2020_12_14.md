## Culture
- Wintergatan is a musician, maker, engineer, vlogger, creator. He has a [very famous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) showing his original magical marble machine. Meanwhile he's been sharing in great detail the creative process of building his studio, and his next generation marvel. I haven't been tracking every step of the way, but I did watch this [display of epic determination and mechanical troubleshooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIsx5izE170). He delivers some hard earned wisdom toward the end of the episode, which is sage advice for anyone trying to accomplish anything.
- [Chandler Travis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Travis) and his band "Travis, Shook, and the Club Wow" used to open for George Carlin. I love their song ["No Place Like Earth"](https://shop.chandlertravis.com/track/no-place-like-earth).
- [Paul Stamets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stamets), world reknowned mycologist, has a great [instructional video on "Garden Giants"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TERv85b9krI) (_Stropharia rugosoannulata_). It turns out that these fungi are "Nematophagous", meaning that they **eat [nematodes (tiny worms)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode)**.
- A fun [mouthbow demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdnIPxPICg8), accompanied by spoons.
- A [sad yet beautifully curated tale from Asheville's local history](https://bittersoutherner.com/2020/somebody-died-babe-a-musical-coverup-of-racism-violence-and-greed).

## Tech
- From a farm with no running water or electricity, through building spy machines for the NSA, to leading efforts to optimize compilers for decades, [Frances Allen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/technology/frances-allen-dead.html) was a pioneer and a legend. In 1989 Ms. Allen became the first female IBM fellow, and in 2006 she was the first woman to win a Turing award.
