## Culture

* There is **so** much in Jamila Woods' first album, [HEAVN](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ha1TUv0o6VnQddOci7GIb?si=loTBaLERRxqpwNeLOiWwxw) (2017).
* [Miriam Makeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Makeba) was an **incredible** artist and activist. Her expansive body of work is hard to summarize, but [this "essentials" album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1CHpiAq4OuaaLz6vioePQQ?si=ORo1Q252R4CjtPLqeQBL7g) provides a good introduction

> I see the light come shining

> From the west unto the east

> Any day now any day now

> I shall be released

## Tech

* I love GNU tools, but there are a few Rust based alternatives that are just better:
    * [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) > `grep`
    * [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) > `cat`
    * [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) > `find`
    * [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) > `ls`
* I just added these two books to my Bookshop.org wishlist:
    * [Black Software: The Internet & Racial Justice, from the Afronet to Black Lives Matter](https://bookshop.org/books/black-software-the-internet-racial-justice-from-the-afronet-to-black-lives-matter/9780190863845)
    * [A People's History of Computing in the United States](https://bookshop.org/books/a-people-s-history-of-computing-in-the-united-states/9780674970977)

## Random

* In Tennessee there is reservoir known as [Watauga Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watauga_Lake).
* What was once the the town of [Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Tennessee) is located at its bottom.
* The residents were transferred to a new location, and the valley in which it stood was flooded in 1948.
* In 1983, the reservoir was drained for a short while, allowing former residents to wander about in their old drowned abodes.
* There is a museum where a [person who lived in the original town tells the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBRADbaDVCc).
* I went canoeing there last weekend.
