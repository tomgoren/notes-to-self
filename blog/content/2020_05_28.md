## Culture
* [Moses Sumney - "Cut Me - A COLORS SHOW"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7on3o8pByhIx1p2qSrad4e?si=2sQk-uKcTq-NhopYRxrpVw) - [Moses Sumney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sumney) is an utterly impressive musician. His creations are ethereal, bizarre, and funky. Sophisticated and subtle.
* [Lianne La Havas - Can't Fight](https://open.spotify.com/track/1zALEEIF3ipCSQMyHBzwPf?si=KW8NPirKSYWV4GlHVsIH9w) - Fun, touching, groovy.
* Fun fact: the guitar riff on track 6 of [Cymande's epynomous album from 1972](https://open.spotify.com/album/2s0y5BFQpUv5YiXsezn4rL?si=Zp9q0TS3QMCs4f0P6JVG-Q), "Dove", was sampled by the Fugees on the title track of _The Score_.
* Can't not feel [Reginal Omas Mamode's _Where are we going?_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1T12bIVHf2tDPy6pNCMEDC?si=l1G63_nwSHGtilVdsuPx-w).

## Tech
* Comprehensive guide [to `asyncio` in Python](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/python-asyncio/).
* Constraints beget [creativity](http://kylehalladay.com/blog/2020/05/20/Rendering-With-Notepad.html) at Microsoft!
* Yesterday I spent a short while writing logic in YAML courtesy of `jenkins-job-builders`'s [`conditional-step`](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/builders.html#builders.conditional-step). Thankfully my cleverness was eventually scrapped, but I definitely learned _something_.
* Joel Spolsky made an excellent primer to [unicode and character sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).

## Kind of both
